# PythonPixelator

This is a quick and dirty Python program I wrote to help me with a sinlge div [CSS animation project](https://codepen.io/Rikkokiri/pen/GwYxjy), because I did not want to handtype eight 40 by 40 (something like that) 2d arrays.

The program takes an image file and sample size as inputs and spits out a list of colors (as console output) and writes to a file a 2d array where those colors have been encoded to simple numbers (corresponding to the indeces of the colors in the color list). It's not perfect but it got the job done for the project I wanted to make.
